# Case 1 in course 02582 Computational Data Analysis Spring 2022


# Description
In this project, we tested 5 machine learning methods and evaluated them on a specific regression task. The project is implemented in Python relying on SciPy, sklearn, NumPy and pandas as well as other packages. The repository also includes all material including data and notebooks. The notebooks contain the models and can be run on the data, meaning that all resutls can be reproduced.

# Data set
The data set consists of 9 features and 39449 data points describing flights.
